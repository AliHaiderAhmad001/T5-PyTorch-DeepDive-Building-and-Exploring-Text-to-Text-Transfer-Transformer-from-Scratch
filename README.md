**The project is under implementation**

**Important Note:** The goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the T5 architecture and its inner workings. So, it's mainly for educational purposes. You can fully understand the structure and working mechanism of this model here, and use the components I have implemented in your projects. Generally, if you want to use the project to train your language model with big data, you may need to modify the dataset file to be able to process big data more efficiently. I designed the dataset file mainly to handle simple, not large, data, because I am not in this regard now.
